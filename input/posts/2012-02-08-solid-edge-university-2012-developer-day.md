A couple of weeks ago, [Siemens announced](https://blog.industrysoftware.automation.siemens.com/blog/2012/01/25/solid-edge-university-2012/) this year's Solid Edge conference. The conference is being called [Solid Edge University 2012](https://www.solidedgeu.com/) and will be held in Nashville, Tennessee on June 11-13\. Of particular interest to my followers is the fact that Siemens has added a [Solid Edge Developer Day](https://www.solidedgeu.com/schedule) for this year's event. Mark Burhop also [announced](https://blog.industrysoftware.automation.siemens.com/blog/2012/02/01/solid-edge-developer-day-survey/) a [Solid Edge Developer Day Survey](https://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22EMW3EBTSP). I have personally fought hard, on behalf of the development community, to get the developer day added back to the schedule. **I strongly encourage all of the Solid Edge development community to participate in the survey** so that we can provide you with the information that you need in the format that you want. Also note that I will not be the only speaker this year but I do plan on making myself available to anyone who needs one-on-one attention.

Having the developer day added back to the schedule is of special significance to me personally. If you'll recall, it has been 7 years since the 2005 Cincinnati Solid Edge event where we have had a true "Developer Day". On that day in 2005, Greg Chasteen and I spoke to 100+ audience covering all things development related to Solid Edge. Following the 2005 event, Siemens mysteriously decided to hand the conference over to [PLM World](https://www.plmworld.org/). What ensued was a 5 year fiasco (no offense to anyone intended) that caused Solid Edge user attendance dropped like a rock, essentially squashing most users' hope of ever having a true Solid Edge conference again. Many users, including myself, publicly stated that they planned on boycotting the events (which we did) until Siemens took it back over.  Fast forward to 2010 and things start to get interesting again.

2010 marked the emergence of [Karsten Newbury](https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/en_us/about_us/leadership/newbury.shtml), Senior Vice President and General Manager of Velocity Series, Siemens PLM. Karsten spent the majority of that year engaging the Solid Edge user community in an attempt to determine what Siemens needed to do to get things back on the right track. This ultimately led to Siemens taking back control and hosting the 2011 Solid Edge ST4 Launch Event in Huntsville, Alabama. By all accounts, the 2011 event was a huge success and a step in the right direction.

If you read my [Solid Edge ST4 Launch Event - Recap](https://blog.jasonnewell.net/2011/06/solid-edge-st4-launch-event-recap.html) post about the 2011 event, you'll likely remember my **"Siemens got it right"** statement. I made that statement because for the first time in my involvement with Solid Edge, I left like the user community was being heard loud and clear.  I think that the majority of people who attended that event agree that 2011 marked a turning point in the relationship between Solid Edge and its customers. Through my involvement as a [Siemens PLM Solution Partner](https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/en_us/partners/partnerSearchResults.cfm?action=company&companyId=0013000000L5NGNAA3), my involvement in the Solid Edge community and after seeing the [Solid Edge University 2012 schedule](https://www.solidedgeu.com/schedule), I feel confident in saying that **Siemens is still getting it right**.
