Title: JasonNewell.NET - Community Update
Tags:

As most of you know, I started JasonNewell.NET in 2005 in an effort expand and grow the Solid Edge developer community. At that time, we did not have a good medium to collaborate so I didn't mind hosting a website and forums. Almost immediately after I launched the site, I started getting pulled in many different directions and never really got the chance to give the community the attention that it needed or deserved. I did my best and for the most part am pleased with how far we've come together over the years.

For the past several years, I have been vocal in saying that I thought the community site should be hosted by Siemens. My opinion was that it would be good for me, the community and Siemens. Like so many other things I've brought to Siemens attention, Karsten, Dan, Mark, etc. listened and acted to give us the new [Solid Edge Developer Forum](http://community.plm.automation.siemens.com/t5/Solid-Edge-Developer-Forum/bd-p/SEDeveloperForum). Understandably, it took time to formulate a plan and implement it but here we are. I personally couldn't be happier, on many levels.

I plan on leaving JasonNewell.NET as-is until the end of the year. After that I time, I'll likely change over to a Wordpress blog site although the majority of my Solid Edge related blogs will be on the new [Solid Edge Developer Blog](http://community.plm.automation.siemens.com/t5/Solid-Edge-Developer-Blog/bg-p/SolidEdgeDeveloperBlog). I would like to thank everyone that contributed over the years. It was a good run and I am confident this is the right next step for the community. See you all on the other side!
