Those who have followed me over the years likely notice that the site looks a bit different. I created this site in 2005 give the [Solid Edge Developer Community](https://community.plm.automation.siemens.com/t5/Solid-Edge-Developer-Community/ct-p/SolidEdgeDeveloperCommunity) a place to collaborate because at the time, we didn’t have a better alternative. Now that Siemens is hosting the community, my site has been relegated to a blog site and I’m ok with that.

There are a million blogging options out there but I want to explain why I chose the solution that I did. If you’ve ever spoken with me, you’ll know that I’m terrible at web programming. I’ve also recently hit the [GitHub](https://github.com) scene in an effort to expand the [Solid Edge Community open source initiative](https://github.com/SolidEdgeCommunity). Recently, I read a [blog post](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/ExploringASPNETWebPagesAFullyfeaturedMiniBlogUsingJustRazor.aspx) from one of my idols, [Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com). In that post, Scott mentioned [Mads Kristensen](https://madskristensen.net/)’s [MiniBlog](https://github.com/madskristensen/miniblog) project. I quickly realized this was a perfect opportunity for me to learn some modern ASP.NET and get my feet wet forking projects on GitHub.

Needless to say, I’ve had a blast working with MiniBlog and learning ASP.NET\Razor by creating my own theme. My theme is still a work in progress as I learn. I am aware of a few issues but I’ll solve them as a I go. Special thanks to [Mads Kristensen](https://madskristensen.net/) for creating and sharing [MiniBlog](https://github.com/madskristensen/miniblog) and [Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com) for bringing it to my attention.
