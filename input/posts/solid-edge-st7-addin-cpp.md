In continuation of my [Solid Edge ST7 AddIn Architecture Overview](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/839585/Solid-Edge-ST-AddIn-Architecture-Overview) article, I just published a new article, [Solid Edge ST7 AddIn in C++](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/840912/Solid-Edge-ST-AddIn-CPP). This article is programming language specific and focuses on developing Solid Edge AddIns using Visual C++. It covers the bare minimum requirements for addin development in C++.

In additional the previous articles, I am working on a series of articles that are topic focused. Here is a quick list of articles that I'm working on. Feel free to reply to this post with any article requests.
