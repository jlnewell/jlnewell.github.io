The following video demonstrates how to use NuGet from Visual Studio for Solid Edge custom development. Specifically, it shows how to install and use the [Interop.SolidEdge NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Interop.SolidEdge) and the [SolidEdge.Community NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SolidEdge.Community). The [SolidEdge.Community.Reader NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SolidEdge.Community.Reader) is mentioned but not used in the video. These NuGet packages are used frequently in the [Samples on GitHub](https://github.com/SolidEdgeCommunity/Samples).
