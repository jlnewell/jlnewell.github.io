		<title>How to use NuGet for Solid Edge custom development</title>
		<updated>2015-01-27T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;The following video demonstrates how to use NuGet from Visual Studio for Solid Edge custom development. Specifically, it shows how to install and use the &lt;a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Interop.SolidEdge"&gt;Interop.SolidEdge NuGet package&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/SolidEdge.Community"&gt;SolidEdge.Community NuGet package&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/SolidEdge.Community.Reader"&gt;SolidEdge.Community.Reader NuGet package&lt;/a&gt; is mentioned but not used in the video. These NuGet packages are used frequently in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/SolidEdgeCommunity/Samples"&gt;Samples on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Interview with Jason Newell, Solid Edge Developer Community Leader</title>
		<updated>2015-01-16T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;Siemens community manager, Matt Lombard, interviewed me last week. The interview was about a hour long phone conversation that he transcribed for the article. It was a lot of fun telling my story. Thanks to Matt &amp;amp; Siemens for taking the time to document my accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a link to the full article. &lt;a href="http://community.plm.automation.siemens.com/t5/Solid-Edge-Blog/Interview-with-Jason-Newell-Solid-Edge-Developer-Community/ba-p/287970"&gt;Interview with Jason Newell, Solid Edge Developer Community Leader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing addins for Solid Edge can be a daunting task in itself but I've found having a solid understanding of the underlying architecture is key to success. I recently published the article &lt;a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/839585/Solid-Edge-ST-AddIn-Architecture-Overview"&gt;Solid Edge ST7 AddIn Architecture Overview&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.codeproject.com"&gt;CodeProject&lt;/a&gt; to share my years of experience and knowledge with you all in the hopes you too can have a solid understanding of how addins work in Solid Edge. The article does not get into programming language specifics rather it focuses entirely on the Solid Edge API and more specifically, the requirements to developing an addin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's next? I plan on creating several more articles that focus creating addins in the C++, C# &amp;amp; Visual Basic languages. Those are the top 3 off the top of my head but I'm certainly willing to entertain other languages if there is a need. Let me know!&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2014-08-31T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;The following video is the official introduction to the Solid Edge Community Open Source Initiative. I spoke about this topic at Solid Edge University 2014. At that time, we were not quite ready to go live as we were still learning how to set everything up and a lot was in flux. As of today, I'm happy to announce that we're ready to move forward and share all of the hard work that has gone on in the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video is 23 minutes long but I strongly encourage you all to watch it in its entirety as there is a lot of good information in it. I also attached the PowerPoint presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2014-07-10T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;Automating Solid Edge from a web application can be challenging. Many have tried, many have failed (including me). In the following video, I dive head first into the common issues and propose possible solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Spy for Solid Edge Introduction</title>
		<updated>2014-06-23T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blob.jasonnewell.net/blog/2014-06-23_1.png" class="img-fluid" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest challenges of automating Solid Edge (for me at least) is the sheer size of the API. SDK documentation and examples are nice but these are static views of the API. What would be extremely helpful is to have a runtime view of the API. This is where &lt;a href="http://solidedgespy.codeplex.com/"&gt;Spy for Solid Edge&lt;/a&gt; steps in. This is an &lt;a href="http://github.com/SolidEdgeCommunity/SolidEdgeSpy"&gt;open source project on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; made available by the &lt;a href="http://github.com/SolidEdgeCommunity"&gt;Solid Edge Developer Community&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote and released the original application (formerly Solid Edge Spy) back in 2005 on my personal website. Open source was not as popular at the time and I chose to not share my code. Released at version 1.0, it had not been updated since until December 2013. At that time, our community was getting more involved in open source so I made the decision to share the rewritten code for all to see. Most won't care about the code itself, and that's ok, but for me it's the concept of contributing my work to the community and opening the door for others to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current release of Spy for Solid Edge has a lot of functionality, too much to really cover in a single blog post so I made a video demonstrating its functionality. I honestly tried to make it a short video but it ended up being 27 minutes long. I encourage you all to download and install the latest release and give it a test drive. I hope you all find it as incredibly useful as I have.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Site migrated to MiniBlog</title>
		<updated>2014-05-27T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;Those who have followed me over the years likely notice that the site looks a bit different. I created this site in 2005 give the &lt;a href="http://community.plm.automation.siemens.com/t5/Solid-Edge-Developer-Community/ct-p/SolidEdgeDeveloperCommunity"&gt;Solid Edge Developer Community&lt;/a&gt; a place to collaborate because at the time, we didn’t have a better alternative. Now that Siemens is hosting the community, my site has been relegated to a blog site and I’m ok with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a million blogging options out there but I want to explain why I chose the solution that I did. If you’ve ever spoken with me, you’ll know that I’m terrible at web programming. I’ve also recently hit the &lt;a href="https://github.com"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; scene in an effort to expand the &lt;a href="https://github.com/SolidEdgeCommunity"&gt;Solid Edge Community open source initiative&lt;/a&gt;. Recently, I read a &lt;a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ExploringASPNETWebPagesAFullyfeaturedMiniBlogUsingJustRazor.aspx"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; from one of my idols, &lt;a href="http://www.hanselman.com"&gt;Scott Hanselman&lt;/a&gt;. In that post, Scott mentioned &lt;a href="http://madskristensen.net/"&gt;Mads Kristensen&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://github.com/madskristensen/miniblog"&gt;MiniBlog&lt;/a&gt; project. I quickly realized this was a perfect opportunity for me to learn some modern ASP.NET and get my feet wet forking projects on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, I’ve had a blast working with MiniBlog and learning ASP.NET\Razor by creating my own theme. My theme is still a work in progress as I learn. I am aware of a few issues but I’ll solve them as a I go. Special thanks to &lt;a href="http://madskristensen.net/"&gt;Mads Kristensen&lt;/a&gt; for creating and sharing &lt;a href="https://github.com/madskristensen/miniblog"&gt;MiniBlog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.hanselman.com"&gt;Scott Hanselman&lt;/a&gt; for bringing it to my attention.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<title>Samples for Solid Edge on CodePlex</title>
		<updated>2014-03-04T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blob.jasonnewell.net/blog/2014-03-04_1.png" class="img-fluid" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've said it before but it's worth mentioning again. One of the biggest challenges to learning the Solid Edge API is the sheer size of the API. The Solid Edge API is HUGE and takes a considerable amount of time to learn. It's also not always obvious how certain APIs work and can be a challenge to get right. Throw in the various programming languages (they all work differently) and you've got yourself a headache. Snippets can be helpful but often not enough to accomplish a specific task in full. Documentation will get you so far but what programmers really need are examples. Solutions and projects in our favorite language that we can open, compile and start learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the &lt;a href="http://solidedgesamples.codeplex.com/"&gt;Samples for Solid Edge&lt;/a&gt; project on &lt;a href="http://www.codeplex.com/"&gt;CodePlex&lt;/a&gt;. CodePlex is an open source project hosting site. This project was created and is dedicated to providing high quality examples of how to use the various Solid Edge APIs. API samples, full demos and addins are available in C++, C# and Visual Basic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;API Samples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The C# and Visual Basic languages contain an API Samples solution that has a user friendly GUI. Simply navigate to the desired API and\or environment and execute\debug pre-built samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blob.jasonnewell.net/blog/2014-03-04_2.png" class="img-fluid" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full demos are created when providing a simple API sample is not enough. As an example shown below, the Mouse Events demo demonstrates how to create a Command object and leverage its Mouse property and events to select graphical objects in the Solid Edge GUI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blob.jasonnewell.net/blog/2014-03-04_3.png" class="img-fluid" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AddIns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also several addin projects that demonstrate how to create addins for Solid Edge. AddIns can be very complicated and difficult to get right. These projects demonstrate what is possible. The following screenshot is from the RibbarBar addin project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blob.jasonnewell.net/blog/2014-03-04_4.png" class="img-fluid" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do my best to think up quality examples that you all want and need. If you have specific examples that you would like to see, feel free start a discussion with me in the &lt;a href="http://solidedgesamples.codeplex.com/discussions"&gt;project forums&lt;/a&gt;. I am also interested in ANY code examples that you can and are willing to share. It's much easier and faster for me to convert an existing example than it is to create one from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to all who have contributed examples so far. As I said in the closing statement of my &lt;a href="http://community.plm.automation.siemens.com/t5/Solid-Edge-Developer-Blog/A-new-beginning/ba-p/17911"&gt;A new beginning&lt;/a&gt; post, we are stronger together than we are as individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>JasonNewell.NET - Community Update</title>
		<updated>2013-11-27T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;As most of you know, I started JasonNewell.NET in 2005 in an effort expand and grow the Solid Edge developer community. At that time, we did not have a good medium to collaborate so I didn't mind hosting a website and forums. Almost immediately after I launched the site, I started getting pulled in many different directions and never really got the chance to give the community the attention that it needed or deserved. I did my best and for the most part am pleased with how far we've come together over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past several years, I have been vocal in saying that I thought the community site should be hosted by Siemens. My opinion was that it would be good for me, the community and Siemens. Like so many other things I've brought to Siemens attention, Karsten, Dan, Mark, etc. listened and acted to give us the new &lt;a href="http://community.plm.automation.siemens.com/t5/Solid-Edge-Developer-Forum/bd-p/SEDeveloperForum"&gt;Solid Edge Developer Forum&lt;/a&gt;. Understandably, it took time to formulate a plan and implement it but here we are. I personally couldn't be happier, on many levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan on leaving JasonNewell.NET as-is until the end of the year. After that I time, I'll likely change over to a Wordpress blog site although the majority of my Solid Edge related blogs will be on the new &lt;a href="http://community.plm.automation.siemens.com/t5/Solid-Edge-Developer-Blog/bg-p/SolidEdgeDeveloperBlog"&gt;Solid Edge Developer Blog&lt;/a&gt;. I would like to thank everyone that contributed over the years. It was a good run and I am confident this is the right next step for the community. See you all on the other side!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the new links:&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>A new beginning</title>
		<updated>2013-11-05T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blob.jasonnewell.net/blog/2013-11-05_1.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who don't know me, my name is Jason Newell. I am an Applications Architect for &lt;a href="http://www.ditchwitch.com/"&gt;The Charles Machine Works, Inc.&lt;/a&gt; in Perry, OK where I have worked for 16 years in the IT department. During the early years of my tenure, I sat in the Engineering building and worked side-by-side with Engineers every day. During that time, I gained an appreciation for CAD and the technology challenges that Engineers face. I was just learning programming at the time and I can still vividly remember the satisfaction I felt helping my co-workers be more productive in their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year was 2000 and I remember how incredibly difficult it was trying to learn how to automate Solid Edge. At that time, all that I had available to me was an outdated SDK, few examples and a customer only NNTP bulletin board. Googling "Solid Edge API" back in 2000 was like Googling for "The meaning of life", no real answers. Needless to say, it was frustrating and terribly difficult. It's not my nature to ask for help but out of desperation, I posted my questions in the customer only NNTP bulletin board and actually got helpful responses. It was those handful of people that took time out of their day to help me that inspired me to do my part in giving back to the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2005, I started &lt;a href="http://www.jasonnewell.net/"&gt;JasonNewell.NET&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to grow the Solid Edge Developer Community. I feel that my efforts were mostly successful but I think we all felt and knew that it could be so much more. The main problem with me hosting the community is that I got lost along the way and couldn't give the community the attention it needed and deserved. There is only so much time in the day and we all have lives outside of work. If anything though, I think we proved that community works and is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today, 13 years after I started this journey, and here we are. As I stand here today, I couldn't be happier. Not having to maintain a community website and forums is a huge stress relief for me personally and helps me focus on the task at hand, helping you. Siemens also graciously granted me "Community Manager" status here on our new home. I'm not sure what all that entails quite yet but it does allow me to post blogs which I plan on doing a lot of. While my day job doesn't involve much Solid Edge programming these days, I have done my best to be the face and voice of the Solid Edge Developer Community throughout the years and will continue to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many people to thank but I specifically want to thank Karsten Newbury for listening to me, Dan Staples for believing in me, Mark Burhop for putting up with me, Susan Alig (Cinadr) for working with me and Matt Lombard for having the courage to make "the switch" and help us grow our communities to make them the best they can be. Hats off to Siemens for listening. If I've learned anything in my 16 year career, it's that change takes time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In closing, I would like to leave you with the following thoughts. How much have you benefited from community contributions over the years? How much have you given back to the community? Where would our community be today if those select few back in 2000 hadn't taken time out of their day to help me resolve my questions and inspire me to make a difference? I've often wondered how many people I've been able to help and inspire. Though I'll never know the answer, I take great satisfaction in knowing that I've had a hand in making a difference. I encourage you all to join me in that satisfaction by being active in the community. We are stronger together than we are as individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>JasonNewell.NET - Past, Present &amp; Future (Updated)</title>
		<updated>2012-11-01T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;In my last blog post, &lt;a href="http://www.jasonnewell.com/post/jasonnewellnet-past-present-future"&gt;JasonNewell.NET - Past Present &amp;amp; Future&lt;/a&gt;, I outlined the direction that I was planning on taking with my company moving forward. Specifically, I planned to focus selling my products and terminating my consulting services. Needless to say, I didn't get too far down that road before I realized it was really, really bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose like a lot of my big ideas, it wasn't very well thought out. Developing software is easy (for me anyway). The part that ultimately led to the demise of my plan was the business side of things. It didn't take me long to figure out that managing and supporting customers was more than I would be able to handle. When you purchase a piece of software, you expect a certain level support. How can I possibly support customers by myself and having a full-time job. Reality check, I can't. The unfortunate victim of that process has been the release of my new PowerToys for Solid Edge. It's sad to think that it was basically ready this time last year. I regret that it took so long and I apologize to those who waited patiently. I'm not too hard on myself though because sometimes be best way to learn is jumping in feet first and figure out if you can swim or not. I drowned, I admit it, let's move on shall we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding my plans for PowerToys for Solid Edge, I'm back where I started. It will remain free for as long as I own it. I will be up front now in saying that I do have a potential interested buyer. The potential buyer is in a wait-and-see mode but like I said, I want to be as up front as possible with my intentions. I approached said potential buyer because they have the resources to grow and support the product. I know the CEO personally and have 100% confidence that they would do a good job if they do decide to take over.&amp;nbsp; Note: The latest version of PowerToys for Solid Edge has been released and is &lt;a href="http://www.jasonnewell.net/component/weblinks/?task=weblink.go&amp;amp;id=10"&gt;available for download&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of you know by now that Siemens has contracted me since the release of Solid Edge ST to work on the SDK. These contracts typically lasted 3-4 months and were right before RTM. 3-4 months may sound like a long time but in reality, it just wasn't enough time to get the documentation updated with the latest API changes AND everything else that needed to be addressed. I'll be the first to admit that the current SDK is nowhere near where we need it to be but I will say that it is difficult to appreciate how much better it is compared to when I started using it back around Solid Edge V9 days. It really has gotten better in recent years but it's difficult to see the incremental improvements because the API is so large. Another thing to note is that because the SDK help is bundled in the installation, you don't get access to the newest information until you install the latest version of Solid Edge. Siemens heard us on that one and is now offering the SDK online at &lt;a href="http://www.solidedge.com/api"&gt;www.solidedge.com/api&lt;/a&gt;. We've been told that URL may change but the point is that they will have an online version of the SDK moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads me to the part that I'm really excited to share with you all. Starting this month, I will be working on the SDK (among other things) for a full year. I'm not at liberty to share all of the details of change but I can tell you that I am very pleased in the direction Siemens is heading with their developer community. That's not something that I could have said in years past. I also want the developer community to know that even though I have not been "visibly" involved in the community for a long time, I have worked very hard over the past several years in the background trying to bring about change. Credit goes out to Karsten Newbury and Dan Staples for taking time out of their busy schedules to listen and ultimately implement a plan of action to address the issues in the developer community.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<title>JasonNewell.NET - Past, Present &amp; Future</title>
		<updated>2012-03-05T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to take a moment and update everyone on the status of JasonNewell.NET. As you may or may not have noticed, I've been really quiet over the past several months. Over the last Christmas holidays, I spent quite a bit of time reflecting on where I've been, where I'm at and where I'm going with JasonNewell.NET. During that time, I made some decisions about the direction that I want to take moving forward and would like to share those thoughts with you now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="past"&gt;Past&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been programming for Solid Edge since around 2000. During those early years, I was frustrated by lack of API documentation and lack of an active programming community. I took it upon myself to become an expert in the Solid Edge API and be very active in the community and help as many people as I could. I have spoken at many Solid Edge conferences and shared as much as I could for the betterment of the programming community. In 2005, I launched JasonNewell.NET in an attempt to start a public Solid Edge programming community. Since that time, JasonNewell.NET has grown into one of, if not the, largest Solid Edge programming communities in the world. I am very proud and appreciative of all the members that have contributed over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the community aspect of the site, I also used my newfound presence on the Internet to share custom tools that I developed. Most notably, Solid Edge Spy and PowerToys for Solid Edge. I don't have an accurate download count but I do know that these two applications are heavily used. Shortly after starting the site in 2005, I almost immediately started getting contracted by 3rd party integrators and customers. While this was a great thing for me personally and financially, it basically took me out of the game in regards to contributing to the community and keeping my custom tools up to date. To give an example, Solid Edge Spy is still version 1.0 which was released in 2005! You can't begin to imagine how many times I've started working on a new release only to get interrupted by [insert interruption here]. By the time I got around to getting back to work on the new release, something else would come up and take me off working on it. Same scenario for PowerToys for Solid Edge although I did manage to get it to version 1.3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="present"&gt;Present&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that has become glaringly obvious to me is that I can't do everything that I want to do and do it well. Considering that I have a full-time job, wife, four kids, website, consulting, products, etc., something had to give. Up until now, that "something" has been my health and well-being. I won't bore you with the details other than to say that even though I haven't done as good of a job as I would have liked, my body has paid the price for me trying to meet my own expectations. My family has paid the price as well. It really was time for me to reevaluate exactly what it is that I want to accomplish and what I wanted to put my focus toward. Since I can't do much about the full-time job, wife or kids, that left everything else to consider. The website and community is relatively low maintenance. Consulting is feast or famine but in general consumes the majority of my extracurricular time. Regarding the products, I felt that I either need to do it right or not do it at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January of 2012, I decided to form JasonNewell.NET LLC with the intention to sell my products online and significantly limit my consulting efforts. The first reason that I'm taking this direction is because of my desire to allow as many people as possible to benefit from my talents. When I do custom consulting for a single company, only that company benefits. My rationale is that if I can focus on my products, a broader audience can benefit. The second reason is that in the past, I simply could not justify my time away from my family working on software that I gave away for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I've been doing since January is getting my company in order, starting a new website and figuring out how I want to package and sell my products. In November of 2011, I released a &lt;a href="http://www.jasonnewell.net/blog/item/9-powertoys-for-solid-edge-beta-preview.html"&gt;PowerToys for Solid Edge (Beta Preview)&lt;/a&gt;. This new release is focused on Windows 7 and the new property system that was introduced in Windows Vista. I went through a round of beta testing with volunteers and by most accounts, went really well. Since that beta preview was prior to my decision making process, things have changed a bit. The direction that I'm taking PowerToys for Solid Edge is that it will now be a single integrated UI whereas in the past, it was multiple separate applications. The property system editor, batch operations, Solid Edge Spy (*to be renamed) and whatever other cool tools I \ we can come up with will all be integrated into a single application. The licensing details are still to be determined but my intent is to keep it very affordable. Regarding my beta testers and those who have donated to the project over the years, they will be receiving lifetime licenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realistically, I don't expect everyone to understand or even agree with my decision. If you fall into that category, please accept my sincere apologies. Considering the alternative of terminating development of my products, I genuinely feel this is the best direction for the majority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="future"&gt;Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those that know me personally know that I have A LOT of big ideas. I always have but focus has been one of my biggest enemies. I'm trying to focus my efforts and develop some of the coolest damn tools for Solid Edge that are out there. Realistically I know that I can't compete with larger companies offering solutions but that's not really the point. The point in my mind is making a difference and sharing my talents with the masses. We all know that the &lt;a href="http://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/en_us/products/velocity/apps.shtml"&gt;Solid Edge app ecosystem&lt;/a&gt; could stand for some more active players. Also, I haven't forgotten about the developers. I've had some really cool macro and addin templates in the past but like everything else, I didn't do a good job of keeping them updated. After I get PowerToys for Solid Edge established, developer tools is next on my list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In closing, I just want to take a moment and thank everyone that has supported me over the years. I appreciate you all more than you know. I'm excited about the future and am hopeful that by focusing my efforts, we all come out ahead. Thank you and God bless.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<title>Solid Edge University 2012 Developer Day</title>
		<updated>2012-02-08T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, &lt;a href="http://blog.industrysoftware.automation.siemens.com/blog/2012/01/25/solid-edge-university-2012/"&gt;Siemens announced&lt;/a&gt; this year's Solid Edge conference. The conference is being called &lt;a href="http://www.solidedgeu.com/"&gt;Solid Edge University 2012&lt;/a&gt; and will be held in Nashville, Tennessee on June 11-13. Of particular interest to my followers is the fact that Siemens has added a &lt;a href="http://www.solidedgeu.com/schedule"&gt;Solid Edge Developer Day&lt;/a&gt; for this year's event. Mark Burhop also &lt;a href="http://blog.industrysoftware.automation.siemens.com/blog/2012/02/01/solid-edge-developer-day-survey/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22EMW3EBTSP"&gt;Solid Edge Developer Day Survey&lt;/a&gt;. I have personally fought hard, on behalf of the development community, to get the developer day added back to the schedule. &lt;strong&gt;I strongly encourage all of the Solid Edge development community to participate in the survey&lt;/strong&gt; so that we can provide you with the information that you need in the format that you want. Also note that I will not be the only speaker this year but I do plan on making myself available to anyone who needs one-on-one attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having the developer day added back to the schedule is of special significance to me personally. If you'll recall, it has been 7 years since the 2005 Cincinnati Solid Edge event where we have had a true "Developer Day". On that day in 2005, Greg Chasteen and I spoke to 100+ audience covering all things development related to Solid Edge. Following the 2005 event, Siemens mysteriously decided to hand the conference over to &lt;a href="http://www.plmworld.org/"&gt;PLM World&lt;/a&gt;. What ensued was a 5 year fiasco (no offense to anyone intended) that caused Solid Edge user attendance dropped like a rock, essentially squashing most users' hope of ever having a true Solid Edge conference again. Many users, including myself, publicly stated that they planned on boycotting the events (which we did) until Siemens took it back over.&amp;nbsp; Fast forward to 2010 and things start to get interesting again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2010 marked the emergence of &lt;a href="http://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/en_us/about_us/leadership/newbury.shtml"&gt;Karsten Newbury&lt;/a&gt;, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Velocity Series, Siemens PLM. Karsten spent the majority of that year engaging the Solid Edge user community in an attempt to determine what Siemens needed to do to get things back on the right track. This ultimately led to Siemens taking back control and hosting the 2011 Solid Edge ST4 Launch Event in Huntsville, Alabama. By all accounts, the 2011 event was a huge success and a step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read my &lt;a href="http://blog.jasonnewell.net/2011/06/solid-edge-st4-launch-event-recap.html"&gt;Solid Edge ST4 Launch Event - Recap&lt;/a&gt; post about the 2011 event, you'll likely remember my &lt;strong&gt;"Siemens got it right"&lt;/strong&gt; statement. I made that statement because for the first time in my involvement with Solid Edge, I left like the user community was being heard loud and clear.&amp;nbsp; I think that the majority of people who attended that event agree that 2011 marked a turning point in the relationship between Solid Edge and its customers. Through my involvement as a &lt;a href="http://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/en_us/partners/partnerSearchResults.cfm?action=company&amp;amp;companyId=0013000000L5NGNAA3"&gt;Siemens PLM Solution Partner&lt;/a&gt;, my involvement in the Solid Edge community and after seeing the &lt;a href="http://www.solidedgeu.com/schedule"&gt;Solid Edge University 2012 schedule&lt;/a&gt;, I feel confident in saying that &lt;strong&gt;Siemens is still getting it right&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.solidedgeu.com/register"&gt;Register here&lt;/a&gt; for the conference and I'll see you June 11th in Nashville, Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*The official twitter tag for Solid Edge University 2012 is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23SEU12"&gt;#SEU12&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<title>The road to 675 Discovery Drive</title>
		<updated>2011-06-21T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;On the first day of the &lt;a href="https://www.seeuthere.com/rsvp/invitation/invitation.asp?id=/m1312dbb-43068LPQEN9MJ"&gt;Solid Edge ST4 Global Launch Event&lt;/a&gt;, a press release titled &lt;a href="http://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/en_us/about_us/newsroom/press/press_release.cfm?Component=124798&amp;amp;ComponentTemplate=822"&gt;Siemens PLM Aims for Solid Edge 'App Ecosystem'&lt;/a&gt; was announced.&amp;nbsp; Why am I so excited about this initiative you might ask?&amp;nbsp; This is exactly what I've wanted for years now!&amp;nbsp; Going back to my &lt;a href="http://blog.jasonnewell.net/2011/06/solid-edge-st4-launch-event-recap.html"&gt;'Siemens got it right'&lt;/a&gt; comment in a previous post, here is yet another example of Siemens moving in the right direction.&amp;nbsp; Over the years, I have been a very loud voice on this topic.&amp;nbsp; My contention is that part of Solid Edge's success depends on 3rd party development.&amp;nbsp; We need more people developing apps and integrations for Solid Edge.&amp;nbsp; What does this all mean for Solid Edge customers?&amp;nbsp; Before I answer that question, let me ask this.&amp;nbsp; How many times have you had conversations with other application vendors and asked if they had an integration with Solid Edge?&amp;nbsp; What was the answer you typically got?&amp;nbsp; How about trying to find useful 3rd party tools for Solid Edge or trying to find a quality Solid Edge programmer to do some customizations for you?&amp;nbsp; Now, imagine how nice it would be to get the answer that you wanted\needed to hear.&amp;nbsp; That's what this is about&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do I fit into all of this you may wonder?&amp;nbsp; Back in February, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/burhop"&gt;Mark Burhop&lt;/a&gt; announced that he was &lt;a href="http://blog.industrysoftware.automation.siemens.com/blog/2011/02/28/changing-positions-%E2%80%93engineering-an-ecosystem/"&gt;changing positions&lt;/a&gt; from the Solid Edge Simulation product manager to director of 3rd party ecosystems for Velocity.&amp;nbsp; He also blogged in May about &lt;a href="http://blog.industrysoftware.automation.siemens.com/blog/2011/03/23/the-solid-edge-ecosystem-comes-to-life/"&gt;The Solid Edge Ecosystem Comes To Life&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Behind the scenes, Mark has been very busy talking with existing partners like myself trying to figure out what was needed to make this a successful venture.&amp;nbsp; One thing that I am certain of, Mark was exhausted after our initial phone conversation.&amp;nbsp; People that know me know that I am full of opinions and can literally talk Solid Edge programming all day long.&amp;nbsp; I can only imagine how much work it has been for him gathering and processing all of the input.&amp;nbsp; Hats off to Mark for taking this problem head on with enthusiasm and a tireless work ethic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That winded back story leads me down the road to 675 Discovery Drive.&amp;nbsp; For those that don't know, I'm talking about Solid Edge corporate headquarters.&amp;nbsp; Yeah baby!&amp;nbsp; I have waited 11 years to pull into this driveway.&amp;nbsp; Thanks to Mark for pulling a few strings for me, the day after speaking on the &lt;a href="http://blog.industrysoftware.automation.siemens.com/blog/2011/06/20/solid-edge-api-at-the-st4-event/"&gt;Solid Edge API at the ST4 Event&lt;/a&gt;, I had the rare opportunity to visit the home office of Solid Edge.&amp;nbsp; Quoting &lt;a href="http://blog.industrysoftware.automation.siemens.com/blog/2011/06/20/solid-edge-api-at-the-st4-event/"&gt;Mark's blog&lt;/a&gt;, "&lt;em&gt;We had meetings with some of our documentation, development, and GTAC (Support) team members all around developing on top of Solid Edge&lt;/em&gt;".&amp;nbsp; I honestly don't think anyone can truly understand what it meant to me to be there that day.&amp;nbsp; For the first time, I genuinely felt that I was being heard.&amp;nbsp; Not because &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/newbk"&gt;Karsten&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/danstaples"&gt;Dan&lt;/a&gt; told them to, but because they wanted to hear what I had to say.&amp;nbsp; That single day justified in my mind all of the hard work and dedication that I have put into the Solid Edge community.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Happy Father's Day</title>
		<updated>2011-06-19T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, I would like to say Happy Father's Day to all the dads out there.&amp;nbsp; I have been blessed with four wonderful children in my life and wouldn't take anything for any one of them.&amp;nbsp; Each one of them are different from the other in their own special ways.&amp;nbsp; Each one has distinct traits from myself and my wife.&amp;nbsp; They are my single greatest personal accomplishment in life.&amp;nbsp; I truly consider it a privilege and honor to call them my children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before having children, my wife and I both agreed that we wanted to do whatever necessary to allow her to stay home for our kids.&amp;nbsp; We had our first son in 2000 and second in 2002.&amp;nbsp; During that time, I was going back to school to get my MIS degree.&amp;nbsp; My wife essentially raised them by herself because between work and school, I was not available.&amp;nbsp; After I finished school and got my degree, I was working odd jobs to make extra money for the family.&amp;nbsp; I will never forget the day that I was mowing grass for one of the odd jobs.&amp;nbsp; It was hot, I was sweaty and had grass all over me.&amp;nbsp; I thought to myself, I'm better than this.&amp;nbsp; I just finished getting my MIS, I have an awesome day job and I have some rather unique programming skills.&amp;nbsp; Right at that moment, JasonNewell.NET was born.&amp;nbsp; That was 2005 and our third son was just born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JasonNewell.NET started from a gap that I saw in the Solid Edge programming community.&amp;nbsp; I knew that I could fill the gap and get my name our there at the same time.&amp;nbsp; In the beginning, I was working inside of our house.&amp;nbsp; Obviously with three small kids, it wasn't going to work.&amp;nbsp; Making my first business decision, my wife and I agreed that it made sense to build me an office.&amp;nbsp; Not having a ton of money at the time, we had to settle for a 10 x 16 shop in the back yard.&amp;nbsp; I partitioned 1/3 of the shop for an office then ran electricity and Internet to it.&amp;nbsp; I was all set.&amp;nbsp; My actual office dimensions are 5 x 9 but it is perfect for what I need.&amp;nbsp; It wasn't anything fancy but it did the job.&amp;nbsp; I have spent an unimaginable amount of hours in this office over the past six years.&amp;nbsp; This office is where anything and everything that JasonNewell.NET provides comes from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you know the background story, I'll get to the point of this post.&amp;nbsp; While I was in Huntsville, AL this week for the Solid Edge ST4 Global Launch Event, my family decided to "pimp" my office.&amp;nbsp; My wife and kids (even my two year old daughter) tricked out my office with a theme that only they and I would understand.&amp;nbsp; You see, I love dirt bikes and racing.&amp;nbsp; I used to race in a previous life.&amp;nbsp; I also drink a lot of Monster because it helps me stay awake for all the hours that I work.&amp;nbsp; The following pictures show their awesome work and truly great Father's Day gift to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blob.jasonnewell.net/blog/2011-06-19_1.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="" title="JasonNewell.NET Office pimped out"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should note that the picture hanging on the wall is of me when I was younger.&amp;nbsp; My dad took it while I was jumping a triple jump on my private track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blob.jasonnewell.net/blog/2011-06-19_3.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="" title="JasonNewell.NET Office back view"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to my family.&amp;nbsp; I would be nothing without them.&amp;nbsp; God bless all of you dads out there!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<title>Solid Edge ST4 Launch Event - Recap</title>
		<updated>2011-06-09T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;I have been writing this post in my head for about 3 days now and I feel no closer to knowing what to say than when I started.&amp;nbsp; It doesn't happen to me often but I am truly at a loss for words that can accurately and adequately communicate what I saw and felt at the Solid Edge ST4 Launch Event in Huntsville, AL.&amp;nbsp; I really don't know what else to say other than &lt;strong&gt;Siemens got it right&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp; There will be plenty of technical blogs on the event so I'm choosing to cover the people side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have often said that one of the most under utilized resources available to Solid Edge is its customers.&amp;nbsp; I don't think that I'll have to repeat that statement after what I've seen.&amp;nbsp; Solid Edge has always had an awesome product.&amp;nbsp; The problem has been that there is more to having successful software than just having an awesome product.&amp;nbsp; The pieces that were previously missing are now falling into place.&amp;nbsp; Siemens "get's it" now.&amp;nbsp; They are listening to their customers and beginning to leverage their strong user base.&amp;nbsp; Solid Edge is going to be a force to be reckoned with for some time to come.&amp;nbsp; Honestly, if I were a competitor to Solid Edge, I would be worried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In attendance was a who's who of Solid Edge employees, VAR's, and customers.&amp;nbsp; I think that I can speak for the majority when I say that it really felt like a family reunion.&amp;nbsp; It was so nice to have the opportunity to put faces to the names that we see on the newsgroups.&amp;nbsp; I was truly blown away by everyone that I met.&amp;nbsp; I wanted to share my thoughts on a few select individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/NewbK"&gt;Karsten Newbury&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Karsten has been pivotal in solving the missing pieces that I mentioned previously.&amp;nbsp; I have corresponded with him over the past year or so via various social media mediums but it's difficult to judge a person's character over the Internet.&amp;nbsp; In the grand scheme of things, I'm not one of the most important people that he needed to spend time with at the conference.&amp;nbsp; Yet, he sought me out and gave me 30 minutes of his undivided attention and listened to what I had to say.&amp;nbsp; Not only that but he is actively following up with me.&amp;nbsp; For those that don't know Karsten, I can tell you that he's the real deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.industrysoftware.automation.siemens.com/blog/2011/06/15/solid-edge-st4-has-arrived/"&gt;Dan Staples&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Dan needs no introduction.&amp;nbsp; I have met Dan in passing a couple of times over the years but never really had to chance to sit down and talk with him.&amp;nbsp; I already had a meeting setup with Dan and some of his team on Friday, the day after the conference, so he really had no reason to seek me out.&amp;nbsp; One evening, I was sitting on a sofa in the hotel by myself when the elevator doors opened and out comes Dan.&amp;nbsp; I always try to be respectful to people in big positions because I know they are usually very busy and have full calendars so I simply acknowledge him and went on about my business.&amp;nbsp; The next thing I know, Dan is sitting down next to me and buys us both a drink.&amp;nbsp; Probably not a big deal to Dan, but to me, it was one of the coolest moments for me at the conference.&amp;nbsp; Needless to say, we had a great talk and it will go down as one of my all-time coolest moments.&amp;nbsp; I'm a dork, I know ;-).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.industrysoftware.automation.siemens.com/blog/2011/04/27/meet-the-customer-support-gtac-team-at-the-solid-edge-st4-event/"&gt;The entire GTAC team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I'm man enough to admit it.&amp;nbsp; I have not always been nice when I've called into GTAC.&amp;nbsp; In my opinion, these guys have one of the most thankless jobs at Solid Edge.&amp;nbsp; Think about it.&amp;nbsp; The only time we ever call them is when we have problems (and are usually ticked off)!&amp;nbsp; I'm thinking about giving them a call tomorrow just to say 'thank you'.&amp;nbsp; I met several of them during the conference but I had the unique opportunity to have lunch with several of them Friday, the day after the conference.&amp;nbsp; I can't be any more sincere when I say, they are good people.&amp;nbsp; You may not always get the answer you want to hear from them but I can tell you that they do care.&amp;nbsp; They are ordinary folks just like you and I.&amp;nbsp; I remember thinking during my lunch with them how much it felt like I was back home in Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.industrysoftware.automation.siemens.com/blog/2011/06/17/hugely-positive-about-synchronous-technology/"&gt;Rick Mason&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Rick also needs no introduction.&amp;nbsp; If you were to lookup 'Solid Edge customer' in the dictionary, I'm positive there would be a picture of Rick.&amp;nbsp; The simple fact that Rick was willing to fly all the way from Australia speaks volumes and reaffirms that Siemens is taking the right steps in rebuilding the community.&amp;nbsp; I had dinner with Rick one evening and I can tell you that he's one cool cat.&amp;nbsp; During the closing ceremonies, Rick lead the audience in a standing ovation.&amp;nbsp; Honestly, I got a little choked up.&amp;nbsp; He may not have realized it at the time but he spoke for the entire community by putting his seal of approval on the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.industrysoftware.automation.siemens.com/blog/2011/06/16/bobmileti/"&gt;Bob Mileti&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Bob, up until last week, is best known for his 'Mileti Moments' in the newsgroups.&amp;nbsp; I had several opportunities to chat with Bob at the conference and I can tell you, he's nothing like what I had imagined.&amp;nbsp; Bob is a cool dude!&amp;nbsp; Besides being a cool dude, he is a very talented engineer.&amp;nbsp; It was a treat listening to his stories and seeing some of his inventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I've written this post, I'm realizing that I could write a book on all of the great people that I met.&amp;nbsp; My point in writing this though is to try and give justice to what I saw and felt.&amp;nbsp; Not sure how successful I was but I tried.&amp;nbsp; I've said it in the past and I'll say it again now.&amp;nbsp; As long as Solid Edge is hosting the conferences, I'll be there.&amp;nbsp; If you didn't make it this year, I hope to see you next year!&lt;/p&gt;</content>
